# Strategy Pattern

*It is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at run time*

## Principles
1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate from what stays the same.
2. Program to an Interface, not an implementation.
3. Favour Composition over Inheritance.

## In Order to Impress Someone
```
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeble.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
