# Strategy Pattern

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate from what stays the same.
2. Program to an Interface, not an implementation.
3. Favour Composition over Inheritance.

## Definition in order to impress someone

```
The **Strategy Pattern** deines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeble.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
